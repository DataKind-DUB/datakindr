# datakindr
A set of tools in R for use by DataKind

This is my development copy, the "production" copy is kept at DataKind-DUB/datakindr. General users should install this copy with `devtools::install_github("IPRT/datakindr")`.

## Dev Guide
To contribute to this package you can either make a fork, develop and make a pull request to this repo...
**OR**
Request to be a contributor to this repo directly.

To start development you need to create a new project from source control. Once it's downloaded, R-Studio will bootstrap Packrat in order to manage dependencies. This will take several minutes. Once this is done then you're good to go and happy coding!

## Dev Copy Installation Guide
To install this package for usage or testing use `devtools::install_github("cormac85/datakindr")`.
